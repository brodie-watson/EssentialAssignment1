                <h2>Interest in IT:</h2>
                <p>My interest first began as a boy growing up on a farm in Cairns. My friend's older
                    brothers had, what was at the time, high-tech computers. They would explain to me 
                    in detail about how the hardware worked, why it made the computer run smoothly,
                    what viruses were, and how to care for the computer. Over time, media such as The 
                    Matrix and other movies were released, which sparked my interest in programming. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During high school I took as many computer classes as I could. During this time
                    I learned BASIC programming, and robotics. We also took ethics in IT.
                    
                    After high school, I managed to land a job as a lead web developer for a company
                    that produced software for real estate agents. During this time I learned project
                    management, as well as Git skills, DNS management, and domain maintenance. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to enrol online at RMIT after deciding to engage in online university,
                    and after looking through the entire course syllabus, found that the Bachelor of
                    IT would produce the skill necessary to become a full stack developer. I was 
                    especially interested in the ability to learn Advanced Programming techniques
                    and learn the .NET framework, as there are many jobs available in this domain.

                <h3>Role Description: </h3>
                <p>The role advertised above is that of a Senior .NET developer. This means having experience
                    and expertise working within the Microsoft .NET framework, building web applications using
                    API's for getting and sending data, or building front end User Interfaces using the Razor pages.
                    This position would require a developer to have strong coding skills in the C# programming language,
                    and at least 5 years experience in a similar role and environment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, although I have 4 years experience as a Web Developer, my time was largely spent
                    in project management or DNS management, so I would require much more time to develop my skilsl to
                    be able to fill a role such as this. However, I have spent time using the .NET framework as well
                    as the C# language, so I feel that I would be suited to a role like this in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on developing these skills in the future via my university course work as well as private
                    projects.

                    My personality type is: 
                    Campaigner
                    ENFP-T
                </p>
                <p>
                    Campaigners are enthusiastic, creative, and sociable free spirits, who can always find a reason to smile.

                <p>
                    According to the results of this test, I am a highly intuitive and emotional person who likes to help make
                    others feel happy and successful. I thrive under good leadership and work well in teams, not preferring to work
                    alone. In a team environment this would make me a useful member, as I am happy to let others decide
                    the tasks at hand and work hard at achieving them.

                    Your learning preference:
                    Multimodal (AK)Share
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with my preference in learning style like:
                    "listening, discussing, talking, questioning, practical exercises, experiences, examples, 
                    case studies, trial and error, things that are real, ..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    As someone who prefers to learn by doing or following examples, this would be most 
                    useful in a group scenario with other experienced inviduals (if I am not experienced
                    in that area) and learning by doing. When adapting to a new job or environment
                    I like to compare it (if applicable) to a prior role of similar experience.

                    this is particularly useful for creating solutions.
